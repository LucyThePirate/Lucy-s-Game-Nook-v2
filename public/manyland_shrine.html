                A: Manyland was a pixel art sandbox game, in which players could create their own characters, blocks, and even scripts to some extent. Notice I say <i>"was,"</i> as Manyland's servers were shut down in February of 2024 due to budget issues.

                <p>
                    Luckily, the community made some tools to backup Manyland's areas before the game was shut down. <b>If you stick around, I will tell you how you can play some of the areas I made.</b>

                    This shrine will be less about the history of Manyland and more about my personal experience with the game.

                Q: How does Manyland work?
            </div>
            <div class="manyland_body">
                A: Manyland is divided up into player-made worlds called "areas," where players can explore and collect creations of other players, or create and place their own creations if they can edit there.
                <p>There were surprisingly few limits in Manyland, you could make areas as big as you wanted, and create/collect as many items as you wanted.</p>

                <p>
                    One of my favorite things about Manyland was the fact that if you saw something you liked, you could "collect" it and use a copy of that object in your own worlds. It was really fun to scour areas for new blocks to use!

            <p>
                A lot of the characters I've made have some ties to Manyland, especially my sona: Prezzy.
