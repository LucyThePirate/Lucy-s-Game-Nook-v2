                A: Manyland was a pixel art sandbox game, in which players could create their own characters, blocks, and even scripts to some extent. Notice I say <i>"was,"</i> as Manyland's servers were shut down in February of 2024 due to budget issues.

                <p>
                    Luckily, the community made some tools to backup Manyland's areas before the game was shut down. If you stick around, I will tell you how you can play some of the areas I made.

                    This shrine will be less about the history of Manyland and more about my personal experience with the game.

                    A lot of the characters I've made have some ties to Manyland, especially my sona: Prezzy.

                    One of my favorite things about Manyland was the fact that if you saw something you liked, you could "collect" it and use a copy of that object in your own worlds. It was really fun to scour areas for new blocks to use!
