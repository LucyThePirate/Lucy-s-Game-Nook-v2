Here the background and sand received some love. The lines in the sand was the most daunting part to me, hence why it got saved for last. It wasn't as bad as I anticipated, of course. I made Orange Arm Man bigger in his reflection so that I could fit his details easier, and I'm glad I did. Prezzy and Peasint Monstre's expressions ended up looking ticked off, but considering they are being confronted by Orange Arm Man, I kept it. I'm overall very proud of this painting, it was fun to make, even with some parts not turning out how I'd expect!" data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">

        <img src="art/ZenGardenPainting5-min.jpg" onclick="changeIMG(this)" data-title="Zen Garden Painting part 9, Shadows" data-desc="Shadows! Unfortunately, the shadows ended up being kind of jank, as I didn't pay enough attention to the fact that the painting's composition was too different from the 3D model composition. All things considered, the shadows didn't turn out too bad, though in retrospect I woulda skewed Orange Arm Man's shadow more to the left to match up with the angle of the other shadows." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">

Still, I was already loving how this painting was coming together, even the mirror ball and all its complexity." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">

        <img src="art/ZenGardenPainting2-min.jpg" onclick="changeIMG(this)" data-title="Zen Garden Painting part 6, First Color" data-desc="Getting started with actually painting is often the biggest mental hurdle for me, as the work needed to paint can feel daunting at first. I find that it helps to focus on just getting some color onto the canvas, working on painting the rougher background features before worrying about the foreground." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">
        <img src="art/zenGardenPainting1-min.jpg" onclick="changeIMG(this)" data-title="Zen Garden Painting part 5, the Canvas" data-desc="Now that I had a composition that I liked, it was time to start puttin' it onto a canvas! I held my phone up to my left eye with a picture of the 3D modeled scene, while I let my right eye focus on the canvas as a way to 'overlay' the two in my brain, allowing me to roughly plot out where all the objects would go. If I wanted a more consistent n' accurate replication of the 3D model, I could have used something like grid lines to help line things up, but frankly I usually have more fun with art when I just eyeball things. Mistakes often lead to interesting ideas, and give art character." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">
        <img src="art/zen_garden_WIP4-min.png" onclick="changeIMG(this)" data-title="Zen Garden Painting part 4, Finalized Model" data-desc="I adjusted Prezzy and Peasint Monstre's positions so I could play with their shadows and reflections. At the last minute, I ended up adding Orange Arm Man into the scene, because I loved the idea of a character only visible through their shadow and reflection." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">
        <img src="art/zen_garden_WIP2-min.png" onclick="changeIMG(this)" data-title="Zen Garden Painting part 3, More Modeling" data-desc="I played around with some ideas for posing Prezzy and Peasint Monstre. Even though I didn't go with this idea in the end, them both sharing the shade of a tree is quite cute. I didn't like how messy the reflective object on the right looked, so I ended up changing it into a simpler design later on." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">

Zetterstrand made them by first modeling a scene in Blender, then painting the scene once he was satisfied with the composition. So, I wanted to try a similar technique! I knew I wanted to make a zen garden scene with my two scrunglos, Prezzy and Peasint Monstre, hanging out, so I made a preliminary sketch to get a rough idea of what I wanted." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">

        <img src="art/Ralsei2-min.jpg" onclick="changeIMG(this)" data-title="Ralsei Painting part 3" data-desc="I really like how the background's depth became more apparent in this iteration. I figured out I could use my hands to smudge some of the black acrylic paint to help make the center gradually fade into inky blackness. The colored outlines on the trees helped to make them stand out less from the background. The only thing I could complain about is the blue grass, particularly the stuff in the foreground. There mighta been something I could do to make the blades direction/size/shade make more sense, but I at least like how it looks at the root of the trees." data-imgno="0" class="galleryimg">

One problem: the color palette I got was mostly greens. The painting took a lot of weird turns, Sam became a rock statue covered in moss that also had Shrek ears and was maybe also an Angry Birds pig.
