    <p>Hi there! I'm Lucy (they/them), a self-taught game developer. I recently realized I'm non-binary after doing a lot of self-discovery. I was pretty miserable in my last living situation, but now things have been lookin' up for ol' Lucy. I'd be happy to share some of the things that got me through the worst portion of my life :></p>
    <p>I love making games! The process of making art is very fun for me. I rarely ever know what the finished product will look like, as I instead like to explore weird ideas I get while making art and see where it takes me.</p>
    <p>website's still fairly WIP, haha</p>

          </li>
        <li>3/17/24 - I added a Games button for the stuff I've made!... Well, maybe it should be called the "Game" button, since it only links to one game I made. It is a cool game though, I think. Go check it out, it's got this little dude in it! <p><image src="assets/art/3D/peasintTank.png" width="200px"></image></p></li>
        <li>3/12/24 - Cleaned up this town!! This website's been out for a little bit but I haven't properly worked on it 'til today. I found out you can use Visual Studio Code to preview the website while you're workin' on it, so hopefully this oughta improve my workflow.</li>
