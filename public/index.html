    <p>Hi there! I'm Lucy (they/them), a self-taught game developer. I recently realized I'm non-binary after doing a lot of self-discovery. I was pretty miserable in my last living situation, but now things have been lookin' up for ol' Lucy. I'd be happy to share some of the things that got me through the worst portion of my life :></p>
    <p>I love making games! The process of making art is very fun for me. I rarely ever know what the finished product will look like, as I instead like to explore weird ideas I get while making art and see where it takes me.</p>
    <p>website's still fairly WIP, haha</p>

    <ul>
        <li>8/7/24 - Replaced the guestbook with UltraGuest, RIP 123guestbook.</li>
        <li>5/16/24 - More art added to the art bucket!! go look n' see</li>
        <li>5/9/24 - Gave some functionality to the art bucket button at the top! Click it and go see some of the 3D model stuff I've made! There'll be more added to it over time, too!</li>
        <li>4/9/24 - Did you see that eclipse yesterday? I thought it was awesome! I got a lot of rare items from the Moon Raid event, too. Anyways, I'm workin' on adding some buttons for my art and also the Manyland Shrine. <p>Have you heard of Manyland? Probably not, but stick around and I shall weave my tale about a game that once was.</p></li>
        <li>3/20/24 - Behold!!! I made a trailer for the tank game! It's free, too! Check out the trailer, here: <p></p>

        <li>3/17/24 - I added a Games button for the stuff I've made!... Well, maybe it should be called the "Game" button, since it only links to one game I made. It is a cool game though, I think. Go check it out, it's got this little dude in it! <p><image src="art/peasintTank.png" width="200px"></image></p></li>
        <li>3/12/24 - Cleaned up this town!! This website's been out for a little bit but I haven't properly worked on it 'til today. I found out you can use Visual Studio Code to preview the website while you're workin' on it, so hopefully this oughta improve my workflow.</li>
